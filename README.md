## planar2

Planar2 is an extension of the [planar](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/planar) package by Casey Duncan. Planar is a 2D geometry library for Python designed to be useful for most any program that needs a convenient, high-performance geometry API. Planar2 added geometry component generation along with update and refinement of the original planar classes to the current Python environment.


### Installation

To build and install Planar from the source distribution or repository use::
```
python setup.py install
```
To install only the pure-Python modules without compiling, use::
```
python setup.py build_py install --skip-build
```
Only performance is sacrificed without the C extensions, all functionality is still available when using only the pure-Python modules.


### Documentation

The documentation for the older version (v0.4) of planar is [here](https://pythonhosted.org/planar/).
